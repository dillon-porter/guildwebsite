# guildwebsite
This is a guild website for World of Warcraft that I built completely from scratch. No libraries or frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Website: This website is for a World of Warcraft raiding guild where players interested in playing in the guild can fill out a quick application through the form.
The form has validation and is posted to a 3rd party api system from Getform.io. Once a player fills out the form the data is saved in a table on the backend of Getform.io. 

The only thing that I didn't code was the lightbox functionality. I found the mini-plugin on github through: https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2
